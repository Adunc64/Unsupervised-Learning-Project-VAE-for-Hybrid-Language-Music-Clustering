I wanna get drunk and get her outta my mind
I want one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

I looked on the wall, at the old clock on the wall
By that time, it was eleven thirty
Gettin' a little late
I looked down the bar, at the bartender, I say hey
What do you want
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well my baby she gone, she been gone two night
I ain't seen my baby since night before last
I wanna get drunk till I'm off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
And I sat there again,
I was drinkin, ' gettin', stoned
And doopin', doopin'
Getting busy with the hand

rock,rock.00097.wav,Made Of Stone,The Stone Roses,"Your knuckles whiten on the wheel
The last thing that your hands will feel
Your final flight can't be delayed
No earth, just sky it's so surreal
Your pink fat lips let go a scream
You fry and melt, I love the scene
Sometimes I fantasize
When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars, they burn below me
Don't these times fill your eyes?
When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars they burn below me
Are you all alone?
Is anybody home?
I'm standing warm against the cold
Now that the flames have taken hold
At least you left your life in style
And for as far as I can see
Ten twisted grills grin back at me
Bad money dies I love the scene
Sometimes I fantasize"

To shoot you down
What a sound
When the day is done
And it all works out

You know it
You show it
And the time has come
To shoot you down
What a sound
When the day is done
And it all works out
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
I never wanted
The love that you showed me
It started to choke me
And how I wish I'd said
No too slow
I couldn't take
That too fast
I want you to know
You know it
You show it
But I can't back down
It's far too late
I can't wait"

This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
She's waited for
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
Oh, this is the one
This is the one
She's waited for

For a month of Sundays
Burn the town where I was born"
