With all the lies that you make  
The things or darkness and you  
Some people say, have just a taste  
Right or wrong, you might get burned  
What you gain is what you learn  
  
Got one too many women  
Don't know quite which way to go  
They're all gettin' so expensive  
When they walk by themselves  
Right or wrong, don't regret  
What you went for is what you get  
  
No point in bitter tears  
When someone else has cut you down  
'Cause there's a time for leavin'  
And there's a time for stickin' around, hey  
Right or wrong, you've got to live  
So what you collect is what you give

And I'm not very good at hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid

And tear you all apart

One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no

Now I can't believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together

When I get in trouble  
I really don't want you to go, no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart

And you bear a son so much like yourself  
And it's hard to believe that he's a grown man

Once every night I thank my lucky stars  
You've given me some guiding light  
But there comes a time when a father and a son  
Can no longer be as one  
  
It took me so long to recover  
From the pain of having denied the love I once relied upon  
It takes more than time to discover  
That for both the young and old  
The truth is sometimes cold but right  
  
This is my life  
And I've got to hold my own

And the wrongs become right when  
We stop and wonder how  
Look at us  
We're better friends now

In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.

Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,

To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.

In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.

Suck the tit of discontent,

Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!

Take away my dignity, take away my pain,

When I walked by and you caught my eye.

Met a girl with a graceful charm,  
But when beauty met the beast he froze.  
Got the sense I was not her type  
By a black eye and bloody nose,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.

'Cause it's the only time

So many people say, it will never work out that way  
You can't stand the heat  
While you're watching your heart  
Just melt away in the basement on a rainy day  
There's motel in Shreveport  
Don't ask me where, please  
They check in, they check out  
By the light of the color T.V.s  
The maid calls you honey  
She makes your bed slow  
And she speaks, of the sheets that don't fit  
But you know that she knows  
I've done it before and I'd do it again

Maybe I'm just living in the part

Or I'll never fall in love

Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing  
I've been told  
  
Love is everything  
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And it's growing old  
  
Love is everything  
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And it's a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing  
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings

When no one's looking out you understand

The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned  
  
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down  
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground  
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend  
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end  
  
Every new version of the way of life  
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide  
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died  
  
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell  
The difference for you between heaven and hell  
To glorify something, your legends are found  
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground  
  
Years rolling by just like a dream  
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine

Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone

Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away

When things were much much simple  
And time would travel slow  
  
There came a righteous stranger  
With a bible in his hand  
To educate the sinner  
And liberate the land  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The sins of the fathers  
Have visited from old  
In a never ending circle  
Of people bought and sold  
So the wretched of the earth  
Would huddle from the cold  
As a ship of fools go sailing  
On an Ocean black as gold  
  
So come and sit beside me  
And let my tale unfold  
In a land on milk and honey  
Where the truth must not be told  
As men of right and reason  
Let the devil take their soul  
For greed and fame and fortune  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all the non believers  
Where hiding from the light  
As a thousand burning crosses  
Were scattered in the night  
The thieves and the vagabonds  
Were sinking in the sand  
As a righteous lord and master  
Stretches out a helping hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And those who had to suffer  
The sick the young the old  
Where sacrifice to fortune  
And left out in the cold  
So with this new arrangement  
The leaders sold their souls  
For bangles, beads and baubles  
And a river black as gold

en,Metal,"She was a waitress in a west Texas dance hall  
I was a cowboy with a throat full of sand  
I called her Honey when she brought my whiskey  
And later I left there holding her hand  
Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling  
She won't look so good in the bright morning light  
[ harmonica ]  
I've known some devils and I've known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night  
But I'll tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light

Go looking in the mountains  
If you wanna find silver  
Go digging in stones  
If you wanna find heaven  
Go reading in the Bible  
If you wanna find love  
Go looking at home.

Embedded in a perfect game  
Can't get enough of all this stuff  
But everything is quite the same  
And all the cigarettes and pills  
All the visions, all the thrills  
They seem to come second hand  
I wonder if you understand  
The mirror is a brilliant place  
To lose myself within a maze  
They moved the moon when I looked down  
And then they turned the stars around  
I try to speak but what's the use  
Instead I scream, I'm so confused  
And when I tried to touch your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(you disappeared without a trace)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of u  
Just when I tried to touch your face  
Just come on here  
What do you think that i can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time I'll be true  
  
These days are fast, they seem like glass  
They rushing in and then they pass  
They have no value anymore  
They seem like clones or metaphors  
And honesty is what we hate  
It's what we're trying to escape from  
I wash my hands a million times  
Like Pilate when he did his crimes  
When we are young we're wild and free  
When we get old we're history  
I struggled hard to fit the mold  
I hope I die before you're old  
It doesn't matter what we gain  
When all our does or dies are in vain  
And when the music fades away  
Our memories just go astray  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(and when the music fades away)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of you  
(your memories just go astray)  
Just come on here

Organize the work for the collective few""  
But as he grows up he sees no change

A world that the lower class creates

We burn that flag for the values sworn  
Some day we'll burn it to keep warm

And becomes fruit eventually!

en,R&B,"Bringing me down,  
I'm running aground  
Blind in the light of the interstate cars.  
Passing me by,  
The buses and semis,  
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars.  
  
But I'm here by the road,  
Bound to the load  
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.  
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up,  
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars.  
  
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in  
With its words of a life where nothing is new.  
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light.  
Oh, I'm drowning in you.  
  
I left St. Louis, the City of Blues,  
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget.  
I tried to pretend it came to an end  
Cause you weren't the woman I thought I once met.  
  
But I can't deny that times have gone by  
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret  
And I was a man when all this began  
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet.  
  
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in.  
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew.  
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me,  
Better by me than I've done by you.  
  
What's to be found, racing around,  
You carry your pain wherever you go.  
Full of the blues and trying to lose  
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know.  
  
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies  
Please help them to learn as well as to see  
Capture a glance and make it a dance  
Of looking at you looking at me.  
  
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in  
With its words of a lie that could almost be true.  
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light.  
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do  
  
Goin back home that's what I'm gonna do  
Turnin' around,  
That's what I'm gonna do

Than I've done by you

mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much
time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little
speed. He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and rockpa had
taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack.

That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair,  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!  
Off we go...

You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.

But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.  
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,  
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured

When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?

Trying to look intelligent  
In case the teacher looked at me.  
She was long and she was lean.  
She's a middle-aged dream,  
And that lady means the whole world to me.  
  
It's a natural achievement,  
Conquering my homework  
With her image pounding in my brain.  
She's an inspiration  
For my graduation,  
And she helps to keep the classroom sane.

Like a little child.  
You got something in you  
To drive a schoolboy wild.  
  
You give me education  
In the lovesick blues.  
Help me get straight come out and say,  
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I,  
Teacher I need you.  
  
I have to write a letter,  
Tell about my feelings,  
Just to let her know the scene.  
Focus my attention  
On some further education  
In connection with the birds and the bees.  
  
So I'm sitting in the classroom.  
I'm looking like a zombie.

I've got Erroll Flynn advances,  
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing.

A long time ago, from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see  
  
(chorus)  
Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time  
  
(chorus)  
It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all

Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice  
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage  
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out  
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron  
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone  
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones  
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind

To the struggle and strain

I'm coming back with a gun, cause I saw that I know  
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go  
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression  
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion  
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?  
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction  
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good  
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be

People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere  
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at  
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game  
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain

With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  
Right now the only thing that my mind ever holds,  
Are long dark silences or screaming that explodes,  
Burning rocking beds with visions of a land,  
Long dark tunnels, questions and calm,  
But, with you, you know I have no doubts,  
And fear will have no sting,  
With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing,  
My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms,  
Continents will crumble, we will find no harm.

Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,

And there's no salvation to be found.  
Well I'll brace myself against the dark, endeavour to go on,  
No matter how long it takes, and even though I might be wrong,  
And I will ask a little favour of whatever God I find,  
And I will come back for you darling, when I find some peace of mind.  
Well I don't know about tomorrow, it will be here and gone,  
I don't know about tonight, it'll be too long,  
Sometimes I think I'm dying, and I don't care how,  
All I know is that I want you, and I want you here and now.

Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought, yea but people act like it's a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But it's sad cause the image I portray the pieces don't fit  
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me  
But I wish people could see, how much I'm so crazy  
In love with you, it's true I wish it was still me and you  
Doin what we use to do, I wish they really knew  
And I wish theyd know I'd never let anything bad happend to you  
I got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest  
But times were tough, and shit got rough  
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought  
But just know britt my rhymes are true  
Britt please know I'll forever Love you  
It just sucks cause there's a few out there that got Nems back

We might not ever get caught  
Going right through (try to stay cool) going through, staying cool

And nothing is better than you  
  
I got a girlfriend that's better that this  
And you don't remember at all  
As we get older and stop making sense  
You won't find her waiting long  
Stop making sense, stop making sense...stop making sense, making sense

And nothing is better that this ( is it? )

It was a cross on my shoulder.  
Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older.

Time had a way of making me see my lonely life has taken its toll on me.

Don't wait too long with words that don't ring true until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine until the end of time.  
  
How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel,  
And how deep my soul, how much can I reveal?  
I'm lost in love's mystery, caught between time and eternity.  
Now, there's a door that opens wide.  
Slowly I will find my way and I'll reach inside.  
But I couldn't make it through until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine and only when I see  
The light of love shine until the end of time.

Baby take a chance with me.  
Baby take a chance with me.  
Baby take a chance with me.

en,Country,"The bed is cold and empty in the morning light  
I'm searching for my pride through tangled covers  
And loneliness is not a very pretty sight  
When you first discover  
  
That it's over  
A hard one to lose  
Love hurts  
It's sad but true  
He wanted my arms around him  
Oh without a doubt  
He wanted my warm red lips  
Soft on his mouth  
He loved all of me  
Except for one small part  
He wanted everything  
Everything but my heart  
  
Love is not an easy word for me right now  
Too much has happened to my feelings  
It's gonna be rough not having him around  
Until time has done some healing  
And it's over  
And I'm over you  
  
Love hurts  
It's sad but true  
He wanted my arms around him  
Oh without a doubt  
He wanted my warm red lips  
Soft on his mouth  
He loved all of me

There's nothin' else better to do anyway.

It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone

It's hard to hold there in your hands

Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose

All the songs that he taught me when I was a kid  
John Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded Love  
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove  
  
Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew  
But in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flew  
I practiced and I practiced til I got it right  
Packed up everything and just took off one night  
  
I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage  
He said the only difference is what you're gettin' paid  
He didn't care that everybody knew my name  
He said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the same  
  
But when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky one  
He's walkin' hand in hand in hand with God's only son  
My faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right  
But I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight  
  
And I will honor my father with these words I write down  
As long as I remember him he'll always be around  
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife

And I promise that even when it seems  
That everything is going wrong

To let go

en,Folk,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Warm and soothing,  
That's how I remember home.  
Walking into arms  
Through the back door.  
Hearing voices I know well,  
And long for.  
Cold and boozy,  
Our holiday in the Alps.  
Sitting in the lobby,  
Mostly smoking.  
Choking on the woozy afternoon.  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,  
My darling.  
Abrupt, too moody,  
You making our party list.  
I remember sulking  
On the sofa.  
For most of the winter  
We were strangers.  
Just one more  
To ease the ache,  
Before the night takes me.  
When you stay asleep  
On your side of the bed,  
Don't look at me,  
Don't look at you...  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,

So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal

And You breathed Your life in me

That I'm not the same that I used to be

To a world that slowly slips away  
That I believe in God, believe in God

And in a tropical way you'll learn how to say manana  
And the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell  
If you'll hear Spanish guitars out under the stars in Cuba  
While the dancers are swayin' as long as I'm playin' tune  
And if you're tappin' your feet in the beat of that native music  
Then the Cuba Rhumba has got you under its spell  
Beneath the tropical sky you'll be tryin' to step to the rhythm  
And you'll shout all day in the way the native all do  
And then you'll walk in a trance and just want to dance to Rhumba  
Yes the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell

en,Rock,"Swan lee got up at the running foot pow-wow,  
Heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.  
Chattering squaw untied the wigwam door,  
The chief blew smoke rings two by two!  
  
The land in silence stands...  
  
Swan lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,  
Loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.  
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,  
Pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,  
His eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.  
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested  
Tropic, swan lee had a bow by his side  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee kept time, half on land, half on water,  
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.  
He followed his ears to the great water fall,  
Swan lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!  
  
The land in silence stands....  
  
Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,  
Confronted swan lee as his song he sang,  
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards  
It was all written down by long silas lang.  
  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands.

en,Jazz,"You're an adventurer  
You sail across the oceans  
You climb the Himalayas  
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state  
You're a queen reborn  
Worshiped from above, afar  
Some see you as an elixir  
An elemental natural, seeking perfect grace  
In a catacomb  
Or cave of endless drawings  
Prehistoric or religious  
Your accomplishments prodigious  
Seeking out the perfect tone  
Your language so clear  
Your voice perfectly turning  
As in the city, I sit yearning  
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars  
Or driving fast in foreign cars  
To capture your remains  
You're an adventurer  
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head  
On the mountainside, they predict your death  
Oh, how you fooled them all  
But subjects are a poor excuse  
When what you really want's a muse  
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before  
Speeds of light  
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket  
Smoking wax - facts!  
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?  
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex  
To lose its grip?  
You're an adventurer  
You were out looking for meaning  
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit  
An adventurer  
You enter as I'm dreaming  
I wish I'd never wake up  
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love  
You're an adventurer  
You love the angles and the cherries  
The height and width of levies  
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race  
You're an adventurer  
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you  
You just will not think about it  
You dismiss it and defocus  
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!  
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking  
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone  
You're an adventurer  
And though I'll surely miss you  
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that  
But at this point I anticipate some grieving  
And although I know your leaving  
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do  
An adventurer  
Splitting up the atom  
Splitting up the once was  
Splitting up the essence  
Of our star-crossed fate  
None who meet you do forget you

So be jolly,  
Have a holiday as gay as holly.  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you.  
When the church bells ring,  
Like the angels sing,  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree

Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie.  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string.  
Do you feel anything?  
Would you laugh? Would you care? Would you cry?

And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key.

I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.

Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
So if you are confused and don't know which way to go.  
You will certainly know. From the moment we're living we die.  
And if it's all a crazy game you don't want to play  
Tell me what you can say.  
It's a joke. It's the truth. It's a lie.

And the music is a rhapsody if you're happy the way that you are.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day.  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play.

Yonnies in the wind,  
We're ruggin' up for winter  
Putting out the bins  
In cold and windy weather  
  
Down by the docks  
Live all the silent sea-ships  
Crates are stored on blocks  
Where now only the rats live  
  
Sail me down the river  
Till we reach the shore  
Diving into the center  
Eating out the core  
  
Down on the beach  
Saluting Captain Benbow  
Always out of reach  
It's quiet when the tide's low  
  
Climbing up the cliffs  
You can see for miles far  
The boat that ran adrift  
Is sitting on the sandbar  
  
Laughing at the waves  
That storm the river mouth  
The ice is on the move now  
Creeping north and south

And heard the curlews cry  
Or seen the raven black as night  
Upon a windswept sky  
To walk the purple heather  
And hear the westwind cry  
To know that's where the rapparee must die  
  
Since Cromwell pushed us westward  
To live our lowly lives  
There's some of us have deemed to fight  
From Tipperary mountains high  
Noble men with wills of iron  
Who are not afraid to die  
Who'll fight with Gaelic honour held on high

For the horrors that you sent  
To our misfortunate forefathers  
Whom you robbed of their birthright  
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight  
  
Of one such man I'd like to speak  
A rapparee by name and deed  
His family dispossessed and slaughtered  
They put a price upon his head  
His name is known in song and story  
His deeds are legends still  
And murdered for blood money  
Was young Ned of the hill  
  
You have robbed our homes and fortunes  
Even drove us from our land  
You tried to break our spirit  
But you'll never understand  
The love of dear old Ireland  
That will forge an iron will  
As long as there are gallant men  
Like young Ned of the hill

Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire

Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary

Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys

So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary

One time too much

That a friend I knew  
Told me one thing  
I should never do  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high

But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool  
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool

Will help someone along their way  
  
You got to try a little kindness  
Yes show a little kindness  
Just shine your light for everyone to see  
And if you try a little kindness  
Then you'll overlook the blindness  
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

Say it's alright Joe,  
I need another drink  
To blow on the glass so I know I'm alive  
  
Play me a song Joe

Then never again will I bother you  
Ooh, build myself a tower  
No way in no way out.  
Then my friends can visit me  
Once in a while.

You never know what you might find in the night.  
Ooh I'm just a busy bee, still alone in my hive,  
I'm looking for some other world  
To dream out my dreams.  
  
There were kings who were laughing in the rain  
And they told me I'd come here to lead the parade  
All the colors were changing, the sky was in ruins  
The lights are all shining on me and on you  
Shine on  
  
Say it's alright Joe  
The night will soon be over  
And nothing and no one will ever know.  
Open my eyes Joe  
I'd like to see the daylight  
The clock on the wall says it's time to leave.  
Never seen the same face twice  
Never walked the same way  
The little love that I have known  
I keep to myself.  
  
If there's a fire it's asleep in my bed  
I must leave it to burn until it burns itself out  
Catch as you can I'm not staying here long  
I'll be coming back early or never at all

Why she worships the ground that he walks on  
She waits up for him at night and worries  
Until he's safely home  
And she always believes his stories about working overtime  
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind  
  
Aw but it crossed his  
Early last summer  
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend  
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave
in  
And now he wishes he could stop himself  
But theres no easy way  
So he lays down with his lover  
And silently he prays

And if I die between these sheets

But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet  
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again  
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way  
To fight the feeling  
So he prays this simple pray  
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been  
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green  
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue  
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night  
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light  
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo  
It's ""Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu.

Wild temptation flows  
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose

From off the street

Payed a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case  
They used to run up on me be like Gucci what you know  
I told 'em get this glass and get da fuck away from me hoe  
And every where I go it became an instant cut  
'Cause they knew I had them 20s and dem big fat monkey nuts  
  
Cant be scared of a dog when you come from Monten Park  
Shootin' dice and playing cards selling blow all at the park  
Had it fresh on yo sister but I used to serv ya momma  
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for da summer  
And my job for the winter cookin bricks all in da kitchen  
Junkies dead at the carwash cause I heard dat dey was snitchin'  
Dope jumpin' out da gym man it helped me buy my tims  
Dope fiend willy used to finger fuck my rims  
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me black  
If ya beat me for a twenty betcha ima call you back  
She on da dope mans dick 'cause I'm a nigga with a sack  
I'm the hustler of the year and I know that for a fact

Bought a brick yesterday gotta four way to go  
On the five way everything gotta go  
Fifty on the table hundred on da floor  
Middle of da summer but I'ma make it snow  
Like a chia pet my money gone grow  
Still servin niggas through my burglar bar door  
Jordans jeans and a little afro  
8 ball jacket and a pair of stash slips  
I don't give credit that's how a nigga get killed  
And if you got a tilt ya car get peelt  
17 going to da 559  
Like a blind man I don't see know lines  
Thirteen when a nigga did his first crime  
Eighteen when a nigga bought his first nine  
Lyin' I'm frying and I sure aint flying  
Cookin' up dope cause the Jays keep buyin'  
Robbing crew lurking I know they trying  
Try Gucci man they ass be dying  
Let me take you back in time  
Let Gucci man refresh your mind

Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  
Never moan, they're happy to be working  
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all

His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone.  
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling, she could really handle
alcohol.  
  
Another one down and headed off the deep end.  
The more we drank, the less that we had on.  
  
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.  
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.  
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar.  
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town.

Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari.  
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun.  
Hotter then a barrel on a squeeze machine gun.  
  
Well, she can get it lower then a Maserati.  
Never seen somebody move that way.  
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party.  
Everybody wants to know her name.

Let down your defenses  
Use no common sense  
If you look you will see  
That this world is a beautiful  
Accident turbulent succulent  
Opulent permanent, no way  
I want to taste it  
Don't want to waste it away  
  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh my self to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to die?

en,Folk,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,  
Somebody more like myself

You think God's forgotten about you  
Here's some pain medicine  
Let's go!  
You're in your car  
You at the house, on you job  
Be encouraged, boo  
  
I've been down so long  
I've been hurt for so long  
There were times I thought I would never see the break of day  
It was hard for me to see your plan for me  
And I tried to believe trouble won't last always  
See, night after night (night after night, night after night)  
I pray Lord don't take your joy from me  
And then late one night (then late one night)  
I read in your love letter that it's gonna get better  
  
Don't cha know that  
I've been looking for you?  
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me  
I'm so glad I found you  
Now that I'm changed, no one can keep me away from you  
Oh  
You've been so good to us  
You brought us a mighty long way  
That's why we love ya  
  
When my enemies tried to come for me  
And they thought that my world was coming to an end  
All the while you knew  
That I would make it through  
I feel closer to you now than when I first began  
Jesus you are (Jesus you are, Jesus you are)  
You are my sun right after the rain  
Wherever you are (wherever you are)  
I just wanna be near you

Loud voices behind the wall  
Another sleepless night for me  
It won't do no good to call  
The police always come late  
If they come at all  
  
And when they arrive  
They say they can't interfere  
With domestic affairs  
Between a man and his wife  
And as they walk out the door  
The tears well up in her eyes  
  
Last night I heard the screaming  
Then a silence that chilled my soul  
I prayed that I was dreaming  
When I saw the ambulance in the road  
And the policeman said  
""I'm here to keep the peace  
Will the crowd disperse  
I think we all could use some sleep""

She shrugs and whispers que sera  
And turns her thoughts to the pillow  
Her face is etched with memories  
She finds now joy amid the sleaze  
It's hard when you've been paid to please  
So she turns her thoughts to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight comes she rests her head  
The beauty of an empty bed  
She dreams of happy days instead  
Of brooding on to-morrow  
  
She swapped her dreams of shining knights  
For pushers, bars and money fights  
For nameless faces in red light  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
Those black eyes don't hurt any more  
She's heard the jokes and jibes before  
She's felt the long arm of the law  
So she turns her head to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taking drugs was not for fun  
It made her feel like going on  
But now she hurts when its all gone  
And she turns her head to the pillow  
She take a blade and breaks her skin  
Sweet life force flows from within  
The white clouds in her head grow dim  
And she turns her head to the pillow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sunlight creeps across her head  
Pale beauty in a crimson bed  
No dreams of happy days ahead  
She'll have no more tomorrows

Satellites will make space burn

We don't like them all over town  
Across the world we are going to blow them down

So many armies can't free the earth  
Soon the rock will roll over

One way people starting to brag around  
You can laugh, put them down

Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
A blanket of newspaper covered his head  
The step was his pillow  
The street was his bed  
One look at his face  
showed the hard road he'd come  
and a fistful of money  
showed the coins that he'd bummed  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
Does it take much of a man  
to see a whole life go down  
To look on the world  
from a hole in the ground  
Too late for your future  
like a horse that's gone lame  
To lie in the gutter  
and die with no name  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Beneath my eyes are bluish black  
There's nothing new, no one I want to talk to  
Nothing I want to think about, I got soul doubt  
  
I stick my head out of the window, it's closed  
Instead of air, I get glass stuck into my head  
The city's sounding I can't seem to stop the pounding  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Not sure what I'm thinking about, I got soul doubt

A frameless Erte, a painting without a signature  
She's waiting for someone to save her  
As I pass her by I see Cinderella  
  
She doesn't fit into a slipper  
Like she fits in a bottle of liquor  
There's no one to take her away  
  
Her eyes meet mine, she sees right through me  
The question is asked, Whatcha' gonna do for me?  
I don't want nothin', just a connection  
I gotta know what she's all about  
Cause I know she's been there -
